# RockSolid
RockSolid is a web app for training advanced calisthenics, yoga, and gymnastics skills through structured progression paths, combining exercise data from public APIs with user progress tracking.


RockSolid is a skill-based fitness web application designed for athletes training advanced movements in calisthenics, yoga, and gymnastics. Unlike traditional fitness apps that focus on reps and weights, RockSolid emphasizes movement progression, helping users understand which skills build toward more complex goals such as planches, handstands, L-sits, and advanced yoga poses.

Each skill in RockSolid is broken down into a clear progression path (e.g., Crow Pose → Tuck Planche → Straddle Planche → Full Planche), with every step supported by targeted preparatory exercises. These exercises include visual references, muscle group information, tendon stress considerations, mobility work, and suggested reps, holds, and rest times.

RockSolid integrates data from ExerciseDB and a Yoga Pose API, while using Supabase to store user progress, unlocked skills, and saved routines. Users can track their current level, build and save custom routines, and generate workouts based on selected skills or muscle groups. The app is built with React and Tailwind CSS on the frontend, a Node.js backend, and is deployed using Vercel.

By combining structured progressions, real exercise data, and persistent tracking, RockSolid aims to make advanced movement training more accessible, safer, and more intuitive for athletes, beginners, and coaches alike.
